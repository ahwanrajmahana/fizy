        <h1> Hello Fizy, </h1>
        <p> Okay! My heart shines up and my smile broads whenever i hear your name "Fizy" wow. You're my cupcake, butterfly, moon and every romantic thing exists in this world and add some out of this world also. I never wrote a letter to anybody but you my love, you're special, you're my first, last and only love. I'm writing this letter because i want you to know how much I love you, like the sea meets its shore everyday, i love you everyday, like the butterfly sitting on a flower, i imagine how beautiful our love is like that, like the moon and stars dazzling in the night, you're the dazzling beauty in my darkness. I love my maa more than anyone and i love you like my maa because from her i knew what love is! I adore you more than anyone because you complete me. The way you're with me without seeing me everyday, you still have the same affection like the old days. I don't want to lose you because despite everything i have nobody but you. Parents love is something different that can't be compared with anybody beside that i love you completely in a different way that is so pure and so passionate. I see a million dreams in a day of our wedding, i can't even stop blushing while writing this now. We had many ups and downs but still chose each other, that's love. I missed your absence everyday at my lowest, i needed my best friend when it needed the most. But it's okay, I'm fine now because you're with me now yay and you chose me. Okay I'll be less emotional in this letter but i missed you. You're my sweetest thing in my entire life. I just want to hold your hand and forget this world. Your arms are like heaven for me and hug me until i smell like you. No one can hurt you i ensure that. If anyone does then he'll be dead. You're my perfect girl. You're my friend, best friend, girlfriend everything. If i have done something wrong then correct me and i will do the same. We are the best. &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp;And we'll be best together. The energy i feel around you, can't be defined by words that is something beyond the world. I meant the world for you. I hope one day we'll be together and may god bless us &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp;and we'll end up marrying each other. I'm happy with you, i laugh with you, i cry with you, i enjoy with you. All the moments are super cute. I still remember the day i hugged you for the first time, it was &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; awesome. Let's hold each other's hands and walk on the sky, I'll pluck some stars for you. You my love you're more prettier than the moon, you shine more than the moon. I don't want a life without &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; you. I don't want to disclose the relationship between us we'll keep it private until its permanent. Your eyes are so beautiful i feel like i would drown in them all the day. Your hair smells so good, a perfume &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp;would smell less than your hair. You know how much i love your hairs and all i want to play with them. Whenever i hear the word love all i can remember is you and my first thought is about you. I don't know&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; about what future has been decided for us but we'll make sure one day that we'll be together. I love you Fizy, marry me fizy, I'll be the best husband for you. If we fight then I'll say sorry first. If you get angry on me,&emsp; &emsp; I'll make you happy and laugh. If i get angry on you please forgive me and i can't get angry on you for long time you know that right. Even if i see your worst side I won't leave you I'll stick with you don't worry and i won't hate you. And i have also anger issues so please don't leave me just hug me at that time and I'll be all okay when we'll stay together. I love you so much my girl, stay mine.</p>
